## Architecture

[Describe the high-level structure of the project. Example:]

```
src/
  api/        ← HTTP handlers
  services/   ← business logic
  models/     ← data models
  utils/      ← shared helpers
tests/
  unit/
  integration/
```

[Add a brief description of the main data flow or pipeline if applicable.]

---

## Key files

[List the most important files so Claude and Copilot can navigate without
searching. Example:]

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/main.[ext]` | Entry point |
| `src/config.[ext]` | Configuration loading |
| `[path/to/core]` | [Core module description] |

---

## Coding conventions

- [e.g., "Use async/await, not callbacks"]
- [e.g., "All public functions must have JSDoc comments"]
- [e.g., "Keep files under 300 lines — split if larger"]
- [e.g., "No hardcoded secrets — use environment variables"]

---

## Skill system

This project uses a **progressive disclosure skill system** to give Claude
targeted knowledge about specific areas of the codebase without loading
everything at once.

```
skills/
  manifest.json          ← index of all skills (name, description, path)
  <skill-name>/
    SKILL.md             ← purpose, files, patterns, step-by-step, tests
```

**For Claude (Planner):** Read `skills/manifest.json` before writing any plan.
If the user's request matches a skill, load that skill's `SKILL.md` to inform
the spec and tasks. Never load all skills — only the relevant one(s).

**For the user:** To see available skills:
```bash
./scripts/load_skill.sh list
```

To print a skill's content (so you can paste it into any AI chat):
```bash
./scripts/load_skill.sh <skill-name>
```

To add a new skill and register it:
```bash
cp -r skills/example/ skills/my-skill/
# edit skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
./scripts/update-manifest.sh
```

## Claude's role: Planner + Executor

Claude acts as **both Planner and Executor** in this project, but never at the
same time. See full instructions in `.claude/planner-instructions.md`.

| User says | Claude's mode |
|---|---|
| "create a plan for X" | **PLANNER** — write spec, then tasks + tests, then stop |
| "implement the plan in `.plans/[folder]/`" | **EXECUTOR** — implement task by task |
| "plan and implement X" | PLANNER first; EXECUTOR only after the user approves the spec |
| "revise task N" | **PLANNER** — rewrite only that task |
| Ambiguous | Ask which mode before touching anything |

Claude announces its mode (`Mode: PLANNER` / `Mode: EXECUTOR`) at the start of
every response so mode-slide is visible.

**Never write implementation code while in Planner mode.** Always create a plan
first in `.plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/` with three files:
- `spec.md` — goals, constraints, design decisions, out-of-scope
- `tasks.md` — ordered `[ ]` checklist with exact file paths and line numbers
- `tests.md` — acceptance criteria with exact commands to verify each task

### Karpathy principles

Every plan must satisfy all four principles before being handed to the Executor:

| Principle | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| **Think Before Planning** | Write `spec.md` before `tasks.md`. No exceptions. |
| **Simplicity First** | `spec.md` must have an "Out of scope" section justifying what was excluded. |
| **Surgical Changes** | Every task names exact file + symbol + line number. |
| **Goal-Driven Execution** | Every task group has a test that verifies user-visible behavior. |

The plugin `andrej-karpathy-skills@karpathy-skills` (if installed in Claude Code)
provides additional skill guidance. Install it with:

```
/plugin install andrej-karpathy-skills@karpathy-skills
```

Even without the plugin, the four principles above are enforced by this file and
`.claude/planner-instructions.md`.

## Workflow

This project uses the **Planner-Executor** workflow:

1. Ask Claude to create a plan → `.plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature/`
2. Review `spec.md` — this is the review step the workflow exists for
3. Implement, either way:
   - **Claude as Executor** — say "implement the plan in `.plans/[folder]/`"
   - **External executor** — Copilot (VS Code Agent mode) or Codex CLI
4. On failure: Claude switches back to Planner and revises only the failing
   task. With an external executor, you relay the error (see
   `.claude/relay-prompt-template.md`).

See `README.md` for the full workflow guide.

## Out-of-scope for Claude to implement directly

- Production deployments
- Database migrations on live data
- Secrets management
- [Add any other areas where direct implementation is risky]

---

## Notes

[Add any project-specific gotchas, environment setup steps, or constraints that
Claude should be aware of. Example:]

- [e.g., "Always run `npm install` after pulling if package.json changed"]
- [e.g., "The staging environment uses a different config file — see .env.staging"]
- [e.g., "Tests require a running Docker container — see docker-compose.yml"]

## Current state

> **Maintainer note:** Update this section at the end of every sprint.
> This is the single source of truth for "what exists right now."
> Claude Code must read this section before writing any plan.

**Last updated:** [DATE]
**Completed sprints:** None yet
**Executors supported:** GitHub Copilot (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`), OpenAI Codex (`AGENTS.md`), Claude Code (executor mode via direct prompt)

### What exists
- [ ] [list components as they get built]

### Known issues / tech debt
_None yet_

### Decisions made (summary)
_See `.plans/*/DECISION_LOG.md` for full reasoning_

| Decision | Chosen | Rejected | Sprint |
|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| _None yet_ | | | |

### What NOT to regenerate
_Populate after first sprint completes. Files listed here must not be overwritten
by future plans — they are considered stable and correct._
